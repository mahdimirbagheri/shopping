.NET is an open-source platform for building desktop, web, and mobile applications that can run natively on any operating system. The .NET system includes tools, libraries, and languages that support modern, scalable, and high-performance software development. An active developer community maintains and supports the .NET platform.
In simple terms, the .NET platform is a software that can do these tasks:
* Translate .NET programming language code into instructions that a computing device can process.
* Provide utilities for efficient software development. For example, it can find the current time or print text on the screen.
* Define a set of data types to store information like text, numbers, and dates on the computer.
